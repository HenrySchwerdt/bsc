# BSC (Block Script Code)

We want to create a programming language that can compile to most relevent programming languages and even to binary.
This would have the benefit of writing your libs once and distribute them for most major languages with the same interface.
Would be cool if this works. To do this we want to create a good standart lib that can interface with the standart libs of the supported
programming languages. Problems how to handle async behaviour?

Supported Langauges:

- C 
- CPP
- JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- GO
- QBE
